|**Installation/Deployment**|Docker Support: Virtuoso Open Source Edition can be run in a Docker container. Installation (Without Docker): Virtuoso is a portable server; therefore, it does not require any installation. Just need to extract the zip file into some directory The zip extraction will create a folder with the name virtuoso-opensource containing all of the server files.<br> <br>Source -https://ahmedchan.wordpress.com/2014/02/19/virtuoso-servers-installation-setup-data-upload-and-querying-on-windows|<div class="foo"><ul><li> Either hosted in Apache Tomcat or Self-Deployed.</li><br><li> Has Docker image but enabling reasoning in Jena deployed as Docker is a technical challenge</ul></div>|<ul><li>Executable for Windows and packages for Linux</li><br><li>CentOS based Docker image</li></ul>|<ul><li>Executable for Windows and packages for Linux.</li><br><li>Provides Docker image</li></ul>|Both Windows and Linux are supported</li></ul>|

|**Security**|With RDF, a graph may be owned by a user. The user may specify read and write privileges on the graph. These are then enforced for SPARUL (the SPARQL update language) and SPARQL.<br>When an RDF graph is based on relationally stored data in Virtuoso or another RDBMS through Virtuoso's SQL federation feature (i.e., if the graph is an Linked Data View of underlying SQL data), then all relational security controls apply.<br>Further, due to the dual-nature of Virtuoso, sophisticated ontology-based security models are feasible. Such models are not currently used by default, but they are achievable with our consultancy.<br>[Source Link](http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/virtuosofaq33_01/#virtuosofaq33_01)|[Apache Shiro](https://shiro.apache.org/) can be used to provide security.|Highly secure with enterprise grade security features.

|**Data Access Methods**|SPARQL protocol over HTTP, any SQL client library can be used for issuing SPARQL queries just as well as SQL queries.|
|**Storage Cost**|This depends on the index scheme. If indexed 2 ways, assuming that the graph will always be stated in queries, this is 31 bytes.<br/><br/>With 4 indices, supporting queries where the graph can be left unspecified (i.e., triples from any graph will be considered in query evaluation), this is 39 bytes. The numbers are measured with the LUBM validation data set of 121K triples, with no full-text index on literals.<br/><br/>With 4 indices and a full text index on all literals, the Billion Triples Challenge data set, 1115M triples, is about 120 GB of database pages. The database file size is larger due to space in reserve and other factors. 120 GB is the number to use when assessing RAM-to-disk ratio, i.e., how much RAM the system ought to have in order to provide good response. This data set is a heterogeneous collection including social network data, conversations harvested from the Web, DBpedia, Freebase, etc., with relatively numerous and long text literals. <br><br>The numbers do not involve any database page stream compression such as gzip. Using such compression does not save in terms of RAM because cached pages must be kept uncompressed but will cut the disk usage to about half.|
